## About

Controller for simplified embedding and controlling Lua from C++. I made this out of boredom so implementation might not be ideal. If you are going to use this Lua controller lib in your application, please give credit to me as well.

## Compilation

1. If you are going to use this library, you still need to incluse liblua.a (This was made for version 5.4.6)
2. Folder **luaFiles** is [my Lua repository](https://github.com/Riyufuchi/Trying-out-Lua) so I will not include it in this reposiry
3. Default path Lua in header file is "../../../lua-5.4.6/src/lua.hpp"
4. Header files are in this repository **src/inc**

## Documentation

- Methods with CLI extension can be considered save as they check and print error message into CLI

## Donate

I'm ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿ student, so few dolars will be enought, unless you are planning to use this library in commercial application, than it would be fair if you will send more, mossibly small share 10% of profits.
