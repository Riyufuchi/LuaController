## About

This is Lua controller that is used to embed lua more easily.

## Usage

1. If you are going to use this library, you still need to incluse liblua.a (This was made for version 5.4.6)
2. Folder luaFiles is [my Lua repository](https://github.com/Riyufuchi/Trying-out-Lua) so I will not include it in this reposiry

## Documentation

- Methods with CLI extension can be considered save as they check and print error message into CLI
